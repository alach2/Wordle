# Wordle Project
First CS112 Project tackling the popular game Wordle. This project reads in a text file of words, and proceeds to choose one to be the target word. The user then has 6 chances to guess the word, with tips throughout the guesses depicting whether they guessed letters correctly or the letters were in the wrong position.
